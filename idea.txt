### ‚úÖ Prompt to Reapply Brand Colors to My Website

> **Prompt:**
>
> I have a Laravel Blade-based website using Tailwind CSS. Please help me **apply my brand colors consistently across all components** without changing any structure or logic. Do not rewrite or restructure my code ‚Äî just replace or enhance the **color classes**.
>
> ### Brand Color Palette:
>
> * **Primary (Dark Green):** `#0D2F25`
> * **Accent (Olive Green):** `#7A8D73`
> * **Background Variant:** `#F3F2EF`
> * **Highlight Red:** `#E15858` (for badges or alerts)
>
> ### Guidelines:
>
> 1. Replace standard Tailwind color classes (`text-gray-800`, `hover:text-blue-600`, `border-gray-200`, etc.) with my brand colors.
> 2. Buttons, text, links, borders, hovers, and badges should reflect the palette above.
> 3. Use:
>
>    * `text-[#0D2F25]` for primary text or active links
>    * `hover:text-[#0D2F25]` for link hovers
>    * `text-[#7A8D73]` for secondary/label text
>    * `border-[#0D2F25]` or `bg-[#0D2F25]` for buttons or accents
>    * `bg-[#F3F2EF]` for light section backgrounds
>    * `bg-[#E15858] text-white` for alert badges
> 4. Keep all custom classes, modal IDs, JS attributes (`data-hs-tab`, Alpine, etc.) untouched.
> 5. Only modify Tailwind utility classes related to color.
>
> When you're done, return the updated HTML or Blade snippet **with only the colors changed**.

Since you're working alone and want to keep your project organized, here‚Äôs a simple system for naming branches and commits. This will help you track your work easily and stay consistent.

---

## Branch Naming
Branches should reflect the type of work you're doing. Use these prefixes followed by a short, specific description:

- **Bug Fixes**: Start with `bugfix/`
  - Example: `bugfix/fix-login-button`
- **Refactoring**: Start with `refactor/`
  - Example: `refactor/simplify-user-auth`
- **New Features**: Start with `feature/`
  - Example: `feature/add-user-profile`
- **Experiments**: Start with `experiment/`
  - Example: `experiment/new-color-scheme`

This keeps your branches grouped by task type, making it clear what each one is for.

---

## Commit Naming (Under Each Branch)
Commits should describe exactly what you changed, and each one should focus on a single task. Here‚Äôs how to name them under each branch type:

### Under `bugfix/` Branches
- **Format**: "Fix [specific issue]"
- **Example**:
  - Branch: `bugfix/fix-login-button`
  - Commit: "Fix login button not responding"

### Under `refactor/` Branches
- **Format**: "Refactor [what you changed]"
- **Example**:
  - Branch: `refactor/simplify-user-auth`
  - Commit: "Refactor user authentication code for clarity"

### Under `feature/` Branches
- **Format**: "Add [new feature]"
- **Example**:
  - Branch: `feature/add-user-profile`
  - Commit: "Add user profile page"

### Under `experiment/` Branches
- **Format**: "Try [what you're testing]"
- **Example**:
  - Branch: `experiment/new-color-scheme`
  - Commit: "Try new color scheme for homepage"

---

## Tips for Good Commit Messages
- **Be Specific**: Only include one change per commit. For example, don‚Äôt mix a bug fix with a new feature.
- **Use Present Tense**: Write "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug" ‚Äî it‚Äôs a common convention.
- **Keep It Short**: Aim for 50 characters or less when possible.
- **Add References**: If you‚Äôre tracking tasks (like in a to-do list), include an issue number (e.g., "Fix login button #123").

---

## Why This Works
- **Branches**: The prefixes (`bugfix/`, `feature/`, etc.) organize your work by purpose.
- **Commits**: Clear, focused messages let you see what each change does at a glance.

With this setup, your project will stay tidy, and you‚Äôll thank yourself later when you need to find or fix something! Let me know if you need more examples.
